		<h5>I find security-level and aggregate-level of primary dealers balance sheet evidences of the liquidity support effects from the newly introduced buyback program by the U.S Treasury.

		<h5>Overborrowing in short-term debt is especially severe because the repayment of short-term liabilities is larger 
			than that of long-term liabilities in future constrained states, resulting in greater cost undervaluation of 
			short-term financial obligations. Therefore, tightening of capital controls should tilt toward short maturities during financial crises.</h5>

		(with J Ahn, E Bea) R&R at Macroeconomic Dynamics </h5>  
		<h5>
		Using firm-level data, we show that abundant cash holdings enable firms to benefit from higher interest rates, thereby reducing net interest payments and mitigate the adverse impact from interest rate hikes to firms' investment and employment.

		(with NJ Hansen, F Toscani)</h5>  
		<h5>
		Using an unified framework with inflation, wage, profit, and import cost, we show that up to 2023Q1 higher consumer prices mostly reflect increases in profits and import costs, but labor costs are picking up. Also, this is not equivalent to rising profitability.

		In response to the energy crisis, bonuses or rebates on energy bills (that are not linked to the current volume of consumption) or block tariffs are simple options which would improve on the current policy design in many countries.

		<h5>
		A full shutoff of the remaing gas from Russia (on top of the curtailment in the Nord Stream 1 pipeline) could shave 3 percent of Germany's GDP by 2023 and raise 2 percentage points in inflation.

		<h5>
		Supply bottlenecks shaved 2 percent GDP in the euro area, and boosted half of the rise in manufacturing producer price inflation. 
		Globally, shutdowns can explain up to 40 percent of the supply shocks. Sectors that are more reliant on differentiated inputs—such as autos—are harder hit.
